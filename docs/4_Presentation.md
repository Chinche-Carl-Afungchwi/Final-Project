# Phase 4 â€“ Project Presentation

##  Project Title

**Underbelle â€“ Anonymous Messaging Platform for Feedback and Interaction**

##  Project Overview

Underbelle is a minimalist web app that enables users to receive anonymous messages through shareable links. It targets individuals seeking candid feedback, social engagement, or anonymous Q&A interactions. The goal is to provide a distraction-free platform with user-controlled moderation and privacy features.

Target users include:
- Students seeking peer feedback
- Professionals gathering anonymous testimonials
- Content creators hosting Q&A sessions

## Technical Implementation

**Frontend**:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- html2canvas for image export
- Hosted on Vercel

**Backend**:
- Node.js + Express
- JWT-based authentication with middleware
- RESTful API structure
- Hosted on Render

**Database**:
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Tables: User, Link, Message

**Architecture**:
- Modular folder structure for components, routes, and services
- Docker used for local development

## Development Process

- Defined use cases and user personas in early April
- Developed frontend and backend in parallel using Docker
- Initial deployment was completed mid-April
- Final week focused on enhancements: message deletion, export, and mobile UI polish
- GitHub used for version tracking and deployment

## Reflection and Future Work

### What worked well:
- Clean separation of client/server responsibilities
- Smooth integration of authentication and messaging flows
- Responsive design and fast hosting through Vercel and Render

### Challenges:
- html2canvas rendering issues on mobile
- Managing state updates after deletions
- Styling consistent across all screen sizes

### Future Improvements:
- Add AI-powered moderation (e.g., toxicity detection)
- Implement email notifications for new messages
- Build analytics dashboard for link/message stats
